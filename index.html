            <h2 id="introduccion" class="naranja">1. Introduction</h2>
            
            There are some professions, such as those related to the audiovisual world, that due to their public exposure offer visibility into the trajectory of the people who practice them, 
            thus allowing their <b>careers to be traced reliably</b>, an example being the working lives of actors and actresses. <br />
            Through various <b>platforms that compile data about films</b> (such as the country where the film was made, the actors/actresses who participate in it, 
            the name of the director, budgets and numerous other characteristics), it is possible to trace what <b>type of pattern an actor/actress's professional development follows</b>, 
            considering at what age they started working, what age they starred in the most films, what types of roles they have played and what relevance they have had 
            as the actor/actress has expanded their experience, as well as what pattern the relationship between experience and role relevance follows, 
            or the type of roles they have obtained at certain ages, the frequency of work performed, etc... <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            The aim is to study whether the patterns of actors' and actresses' professional lives are different based on gender. <br />
            <b>Comparisons</b> are intended to be carried out, such as, for example, seeing if the pattern changes in case the feature film 
            is directed by a man or a woman or if in different countries/cultures this pattern behaves differently 
            (for example, it could be that in Bollywood cinema actresses are especially young compared to other film industries due to the requirement for greater agility for dancing). <br>
            The aim is to understand the <b>relationships between characters</b> and how they change with age. <br />
            Through this study, it is also proposed to determine what type of <b>characters</b> actors and actresses play <b>according to their age and whether they follow the same patterns</b>: for example, if from age 30 female characters are mostly mothers,
            it would be expected that at the same age, approximately, male characters are fathers.

            <h2 id="creacion" class="naranja">2. Technical Aspects of Dataset Creation</h2>
            The film data for this study has been extracted from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank"> The Movie Database (TMDB):  https://www.themoviedb.org/ </a>. <br />
            A dataset has been created with the 300 most voted films of each year. The study is limited to films released between 1970 and 2021. (so our sample will be approximately 15,300 films).<br />
            The data extracted from TMDB is stored in a graph-based NoSQL database, in this case the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/graph/graph-introduction"  target="_blank">Azure Cosmos DB Gremlin API</a>.  <br />

            <a href="https://github.com/isabelcabezasm/TFM" target="_blank">Check the ETL application code in this GitHub repository.</a><br /> <br/> 
            The charts that illustrate this study are made with <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" >Microsoft Power BI.</a>

        <div class="exploracion" style="margin:5% 15% 0 5%">
            <h2 id="exploracion" class="naranja">3. Initial Dataset Exploration</h2>            

            In the following diagram we can see a <b>graphical representation of the graph-oriented NoSQL database</b> that has been created for this study. 
            In this case only films and actors are represented, but we can interact with it to see which actors or actresses share the films "Little Women", "Don't look up", "Dune", "Call me by your name" and "Spider-man" <br />
            <br />
            We also see that the majority of films in our sample (49.21%) are American. This percentage is followed by far by 8.98% of French films. <br />
            Only female and male genders will be considered, since although some people identify as "Non-binary", in this case the percentage is too small to be able to draw reliable statistics or conclusions. <br />
