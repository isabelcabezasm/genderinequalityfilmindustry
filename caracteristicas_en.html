            This interactive chart (Chart 7) allows selecting (at the bottom) the name with which a character is being described (girl/boy, daughter/son...) 
            and establishing a visual comparison between the different adjectives. <br />
            Additionally, it also offers the option to compare data according to context. With the help of a slider I can select a specific period of years and analyze what happens at different moments. <br /><br />
            It can be seen that for example between the years 1970 and 1999, there were 10 single mothers and 6 divorced. While between 2000 and 2021 the number of single mothers has reached 23, <b>adapting to a new
            reality of single-parent families</b>, and divorced mothers cease to have so much prominence: we only have 3 in this period. <br />
            This contrasts with the fact that for the first period (1970-1999) no one talked about single fathers and there were three divorced, but in the second stage three single fathers already appear and no divorced father. <br />
            In absolute figures we find <b>many more mothers than fathers</b>, but the presence of these roles is widely analyzed in section <a href="roles_en.html#profesiones">6.3. Professions vs. Family Comparison.</a>
            of the following section. <br /><br />
            As a brief review we see contrasts in other family members in the two time periods we are analyzing - the first between the 70s and 1999 - and the second between 2000 and 2021. <br/> 
            For example, the number of <b>grandmothers</b> has decreased (from 10 to 3) and moreover before they were more <b>sweet, maternal or compassionate</b>, and more recently we have sick and alcoholic grandmothers.<br />
            <br /><br />
            In general there are 20% more brothers than sisters (normal if we consider that the majority of the cast are men as we have seen previously), 
            but the three most repeated adjectives in both cases and in the same order in terms of number of appearances are the same for both genders: young, older, small. 
            Although we do find adjectives for sisters, which as we will see in section <a href="roles_en.html#fisicoycaracter">6.2. Physical Description vs. Character Comparison.</a> and 
            <a href="roles_en.html#saludmental">6.4. Mental Health.</a> apply much more to women, such as sexy, beautiful, disabled, depressed, etc... <br />
            And the same happens with boys, with adjectives like successful, hardworking, ambitious or aggressive. <br />

            Chart 7. <br />  <br />

            Although the technique that has been used to search for this set of adjectives is different from the one that has been used in the following section <br />
            (here specific words have been searched that refer to women such as <i>mother</i>, <i>grandmother</i>, <i>aunt</i>, <i>sister</i>, <i>girlfriend</i> and the same with men - using the corresponding masculine forms and 
            in the following section the search has focused on the character name that appears in the synopsis) <br />
            it is observed that the adjectives and their types for women and men coincide in this section and in the following one. <br />
            <b>Women</b> are described with adjectives that <b>describe their physical appearance</b> more than their character, we also find more women defined through a <b>relationship with a man</b> (mother of a son, daughter of a father, etc...) and
            other adjectives that are the same as those of <b>gender roles</b> (sweet, beloved, wonderful, silent, etc...) <br />
            For their part, <b>men</b> are described less in terms of physical appearance and more in terms of their <b>character</b> (mysterious, kind, coercive, angry, etc...), there are fewer fathers, sons, grandfathers, and also coincide 
            <b>more aggressive adjectives</b> (alcoholic, angry, abusive...).
